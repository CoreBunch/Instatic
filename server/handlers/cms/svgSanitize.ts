/**
 * Server-side SVG sanitizer (string-based).
 *
 * SVG is allowed through the media-library upload path so users can import
 * iconography, logos, and decorative assets from static-site bundles. But SVG
 * is XML with a script surface — anything stored in the media library is
 * served as `image/svg+xml` and can be embedded inline (`<img src=…>` or
 * directly) in published pages, so a malicious payload would execute in the
 * publisher's origin. The known active vectors:
 *
 *   1. `<script>…</script>` — direct JS execution.
 *   2. `<foreignObject>` — can embed arbitrary HTML (incl. <script>, iframes).
 *   3. `on*` event-handler attributes (`onload`, `onclick`, …).
 *   4. `javascript:` URLs inside `href` / `xlink:href`.
 *   5. `<a>` elements pointing at `javascript:` URLs.
 *
 * Why string-based rather than DOMPurify: the server runs on Bun with
 * happy-dom as its DOM. happy-dom does NOT parse SVG element trees the way
 * DOMPurify's SVG profile expects — DOMPurify drops EVERY SVG child element
 * (rect/circle/path/…), leaving only an empty `<svg></svg>` wrapper. That
 * gutting makes DOMPurify unusable for SVG in this runtime. SVG's dangerous
 * surface is small and well-defined, so a targeted string sanitizer is the
 * correct, predictable, dependency-free choice here. (Richtext HTML still
 * uses DOMPurify — happy-dom handles HTML fine; only SVG is broken.)
 *
 * Defense in depth: the sanitised bytes are what hit disk AND what the browser
 * receives, with no out-of-band cleaning step. Static assets are also served
 * with their own headers; this sanitiser is the content-level guard.
